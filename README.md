# YouTube Tracker

Monitor YouTube channels using **RSS feeds**,
and add new videos to a **collection in Raindrop.io**.

The application runs in a loop, checking for new videos every X minutes (frequency).
Each run will add new videos uploaded since the last run
(the cache file contains video IDs from the previous run).

## üéÅ Features

## üßæ Configuration

The configuration file is located at `config/production.yaml`. Here is an example configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
frequency: 30 # minutes
raindrop_token: "your_raindrop_token"
raindrop_collection_id: "your_collection_id"
cache_file_path: "/data/cache.json"
feeds:
  - name: DevOpsToolkit
    channel_id: UCfz8x0lVzJpb_dgWm9kPVrw
  - name: Mateusz Chrobok
    channel_id: UCTTZqMWBvLsUYqYwKTdjvkw
  # Add more channels as needed
```

## üß™ Development

To start the application for local development:

```shell
bun src/index.ts config/production.yaml
```

To run a single script:

```shell
bun <script_name>
```

[./src/youtube.ts](./src/youtube.ts) file can be executed separately
to test the YouTube functionality.
When running the script in this way, the configuration file is not required.
For more details, see the script's `if (import.meta.main) {}` block.

## üì¶ Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image:

```shell
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t local/youtube-tracker .
```

## üßΩ Formatting Code

To format the code using Prettier:

```shell
bun x prettier --write .
```
